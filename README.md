## About the Repository
This repository contains all the R analyses associated with the research published in the article titled **Jaguar at the Edge: movement patterns in human-altered landscapes**. This study examines how jaguars (_Panthera onca_) navigate fragmented landscapes and anthropogenic structures, such as roads and agricultural areas, using GPS data from 54 individuals across South America. The findings reveal a preference for natural areas, with more time spent in large forest patches and slower movement in natural drainages, while agricultural areas and road proximity result in fewer revisits and faster movement, highlighting the species' risks and tolerance in human-altered landscapes.

Due to the large size of environmental databases and some datasets, this repository includes only a sample of scripts to replicate parts of the study.

## Repository Contents
- **Analysis Scripts**: Scripts are used for statistical analysis and data processing.
- Since the Prepare the data, the Final model and graphics

We used the open resource: **Jaguar movement database: a GPS-based movement dataset of an apex predator in the Neotropics** 

## Usage
To use the scripts and data:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have R installed along with the necessary packages mentioned in the scripts.
3. Run the scripts in numerical order to replicate the analysis.
